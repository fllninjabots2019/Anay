# ReadME

This Github account is for the ninjabots to import and share their code related to robotics. The team will use this space whenever necessary.

Each group member has a folder(called a repository) that they have been given. This space is for them to work with and they can test their own code. There also is a folder called modules, which is the folder for all the different motors, sensors, etc. These will be like the functions that we can use later.

Finally, there is a release folder which will be the actual folder we use. This is only used by the judges, but we'll get to that later.
-------------------------------------------------------- Code format --------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the release folder, there will already be some folders which will be templates for everyone else. There is a source (src) folder, which will consist of the algorithms to solve each mission. For instance, if you look into the source folder in release, there should be a mission one and mission two folder. Each of these folders will eventually have an algorithm in it. These algorithms are like the blocks that we used in the mindstorms program, which will be the actual code.

Then, there will be a modules file which will (like said above) contain all the different functions and function calls. This like like gyro.h (the .h part similar to C) and how it calls the .c file .

The document file is basically the myblock of the code. There, you will specify the usage of the functions.



------------------------------------------------------ Usage ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use these files, you can clone them and use them in their respective directories. Then, you can use these to tinker around and play with.
